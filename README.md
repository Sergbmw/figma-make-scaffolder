# Figma Make Scaffolder - VS Code Extension

> **Hey [@sucoro-ai](https://www.sucoro.com) & "Shouldn't have had to make this but here we are @figma..."** 
> 
> Look, this is what happens when you make a product that does ALMOST everything perfectly and solves a massive pain point in the design-to-dev world. We've all been there - those clients who want everything pixel-perfect, right? Figma Make gets us 95% of the way there, but then... well, here we are building workarounds.

> Shoutout to [@spetro511](https://surenscreations.com) for this figma-make-scaffolder - use it, love it, but fair warning: Figma will probably push an update tomorrow that breaks everything. Such is life! ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
