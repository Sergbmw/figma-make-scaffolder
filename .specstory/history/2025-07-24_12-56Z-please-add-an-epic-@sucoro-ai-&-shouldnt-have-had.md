Please add an epic @Sucoro-AI & "Shouldnt have had to make this but here we are @figma..." This is the trouble that comes with making a product that does ALMOST everything so well and solves a huge painpoint in the vibe design world (and even the ordinary dev world, we've all had those to-the-pixel clients amirite??) @spetro511/figma-make-scaffolder - go forth and use it till tmrw when figma will prob push an update to Make.

I'll add an epic introduction to the README that captures the sentiment you've described. Let me add this right after the title and before the current description. 
```

```
Perfect! I've added the epic introduction to your README file. The addition captures the sentiment about Figma's near-perfect but not-quite-complete solution and the necessity of creating this workaround. The blockquote format makes it stand out as a special message while maintaining the professional structure of the documentation.
