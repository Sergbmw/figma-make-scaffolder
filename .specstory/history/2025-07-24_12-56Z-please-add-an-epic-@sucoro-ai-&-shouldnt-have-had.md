Please add an epic @Sucoro-AI & "Shouldnt have had to make this but here we are @figma..." This is the trouble that comes with making a product that does ALMOST everything so well and solves a huge painpoint in the vibe design world (and even the ordinary dev world, we've all had those to-the-pixel clients amirite??) @spetro511/figma-make-scaffolder - go forth and use it till tmrw when figma will prob push an update to Make.

I'll add an epic introduction to the README that captures the sentiment you've described. Let me add this right after the title and before the current description. 
```

```
Perfect! I've added the epic introduction to your README file. The addition captures the sentiment about Figma's near-perfect but not-quite-complete solution and the necessity of creating this workaround. The blockquote format makes it stand out as a special message while maintaining the professional structure of the documentation.

make it more human, and tag @sucoro-ai and www.sucoro.com and surenscreations.com

_**Assistant**_

I'll make the introduction more human and conversational while adding the requested tags and links. 
```

```
Perfect! I've made the introduction much more human and conversational. The changes include:

- More natural, casual language ("Hey", "Look", "Such is life!")
- Proper linking to the websites you mentioned
- A more relatable tone about the client-developer experience
- Added some personality with emojis and casual expressions
- Formatted the credits nicely at the bottom
- Made the Figma update joke more conversational

The tone now feels much more like a real person talking about their frustrations and solutions, rather than formal documentation.

checkout and push to a new branch, revert anty changes made by a pull and create a PR

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you create a new branch, revert any changes, and create a PR. Let me start by checking the current git status and creating a new branch. I can see that your local branch has diverged from the remote main branch. Let me create a new branch first, then we'll handle the divergence. Now let's see what commits we have locally that differ from the remote: And let's see what's in the remote that we don't have:
